Gheg can either serve as a standard proxy spam bot or distribute its messages via the Internet providerÕs mail server."LuaBot,3,2016,17,"LuaBot is a backdoor Trojan horse whose name is based on the fact that it is the first botnet to be written in the Lua programming language. ÊIt targets Linux systems and any smart devices that have a C&C (command and control) center located in the Netherlands. ÊAfter gaining access, the attacker is able to send encrypted, remote commands to the bots. ÊMoreover, a security researcher claims that while there is no solid proof of the LuaBotÕs specific purpose, it appears to perform DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks due to its involvement in the infected Linux systems."TR/Dldr.Agent.JKH,4,2009,17,"TR/Dldr.Agent/JKH ranked fifth in DamballaÕs Top 10 Most Wanted Botnets of 2009. ÊIt is a RAT (remote-access Trojan) that, once installed onto a computer, remains dormant (and usually undetected) until it receives its commands from its C&C (command and control) server. ÊIt is able to display fake advertisements on infected computer screens, classifying it as a clickbot. ÊUsers clicking on said ads generate revenue for the attacker. ÊIt is estimated that 1.2 million computers in the U.S. have fallen victim to this scam."Dorifel,20,2012,1,"Dorifel is a banking Trojan horse botnet that is used to steal banking and log-in credentials.  It is installed onto a computer through malicious emails, self-replication, or through Zeus or Citadel infections.  Once installed, it targets specific files to infect (e.g. Microsoft Office or other files on network-mapped or removable drives) and encrypts them in order to spread to other devices.  The files then install the actual malware, which copies itself and launches automatically each time the system starts.  It connects to malicious URLÕs, communicates via HTTP requests with the C&C (command and control) server to download additional malware, updates itself, and steals user data."Induc.C,0,2011,2,"Induc.C is a botnet that comes from the Induc family, which has three versions: Induc.A, Induc.B, and Induc.C. ÊInduc.A essentially has no functions other than Delphi-written file infection, and is considered a proof-of-concept. ÊInduc. B is similar but expands its file-infecting abilities to BDR (Borland Developer Studio) and Codegear BDR, adds anti-debugging software, and obfuscates the code to make detection more difficult. ÊInduc.C introduced the botnet capability, creating a unique ID for each bot, stealing credentials, infecting any .EXE files and removable devices to spread infection, and creates a backdoor through which other malware can be installed onto an infected machine. ÊOver 80 percent of victims are located in Russia or Slovakia."Morto,18,2011,18,"Morto is the first Internet worm to use RDP (remote desktop protocol) to attack Windows machines.  It searches networks for machines with port 3389 and uses brute-force attacks to compromise them.

ÊLizardStresser communicates with its C&C servers through a simplified IRC protocol."Lurk,20,2014,8,"Lurk was a Trojan horse that targeted Russian banks. ÊThe attackers were estimated to have stolen $45 million before they were arrested. It was installed onto a computer which had a vulnerable version of Flash, through the Angler exploit kit. ÊEach of the bots reported to one of the 125-or-more C&C (command and control) centers. Communication with the C&C servers occurred through HTTP requests. ÊIts data was hidden behind heavy encryption and digital steganography, which made it difficult to detect."Duqu,11,2011,16,"Duqu is an advanced intelligence-gathering worm, with only about 50 victims. Most of the infections targeted industrial control system companies, suggesting that Duqu is a foundation for and a foreshadowing of the Stuxnet botnet. ÊIt arrives onto a computer through a malicious Word document email attachment. ÊIt is able to install itself through zero-day Windows kernel exploit, stealing information, certificates, and keys through key-logging.

It communicates with its C&C (command and control) server through random HTTP requests that vary each time.  It receives an activation date and time from the C&C, and falls into a hibernation mode to remain hidden until it reaches its activation date.  Once it takes over a system, its main goal is to steal all of the data that it can find, but is also able to kill processes."Vinself,2,2010,16,"Vinself is a backdoor Trojan that was created by the same botmasters as those of Leouncia.  It is a data-stealer that is able to function fully even with a firewall in place.  Evidence suggest that the target victims are not home users but rather corporations and other organizations that involve sensitive networks with confidential documentation and intelligence.  Vinself communicates with its C&C (command and control) center via dynamic, randomly-generating HTTP requests.  Once it has been installed onto a computer, it receives a command with an activation date and time, and remains in hibernation until the time comes for it to launch itself and take over the system."Locky,17,2016,9,"Locky is a crypto-ransomware that spreads primarily via the spam email campaigns of the Necurs botnet.  If a victim opens the infected email attachment, Locky installs itself and connects the compromised computer to the C&C (command and control) server, turning the machine into a bot.  It also encrypts the victimÕs files and demands a ransom in order for the victim to regain access to the infected computer.  More than once, Necurs and Locky have been taken down only to rise again; researches expect to see this ransomware yet again in the future."LusyPOS,20,2014,15,"LusyPOS is a mixture between the Chewbacca and Dexter botnets.  Like Chewbacca, LusyPOS uses the Tor network to communicate anonymously with its C&C (command and control) center.  Like Dexter, it steals payment card data from its compromised point-of-sale (POS) systems via RAM scraping, and it validates the data through the Luhn algorithm.  It is sold on the black market for approximately $2,000.  Of the 54 antivirus programs on VirusTotal, only seven of them have been able to detect LusyPOS, due to its use of the Tor network."Leet,7,2016,4,"Leet is a massive IoT (Internet of Things) botnet that launched a two-round DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack against Imperva. ÊThe first round peaked at 400 Gbps (Gigabits per second), but the second reached a whopping 650 Gbps and 150 Mpps (million packets per second), rivaling that of Mirai. ÊLeet received its name from the packetsÕ TCP (transmission control protocol) options, which were consistently made into a sort of signature to read Ò1337Ó and translates into ÒLeet,Ó or Òelite.Ó ÊWhile LeetÕs use of IP spoofing makes it difficult to track the geolocations of the compromised devices that engage in the botnet, it is estimated to have comprised thousands of bots."Viknok,7,2013,6,"Viknok is a Trojan horse that steals operating-system privileges of compromised Windows machines and uses the bots to perform click fraud, targeting victims in the United States. ÊIn April 2014,  a large number of infections occurred in which audio clips would play randomly through a botÕs speakers, and in May of that year  16,500 new infections alone were introduced.

ÊIt runs automatically when its infected computers start and is able to shut down or restart the bot, uninstall itself, perform a variety of floods: HTTP, TCP, SYN, and ICMP, and perform 16 different types of DDOS attacks, including IPH and UDH."KINS,1,2011,11,"KINS is a banking Trojan horse that contains binaries of the ZeusVM financial malware and is based upon the leaked Zeus source code.  It uses steganography to hide its data in a JPG image file and reports to its C&C (command and control) center through a security software that is detected in its infected machines, but it is otherwise quite standard and unimaginative in its advancement and features.  Before it was discovered, since as early as December 2011, it was active mostly in Europe and targeted financial institutions primarily in Germany and the Netherlands.  In June of 2015, the source code was leaked online and thus freely available for the rapid dispersion of KINS."DNSChanger,4,2006,8,"DNSChanger is a Trojan horse that alters an infected computerÕs DNS (domain name system) settings. ÊIt is able to spread through both Windows and Mac operating systems, switching the original settings to DNS server addresses which the attacker has control of. ÊThis, along with blocking security software, gives the attacker the ability to redirect the web traffic on victimsÕ browser sessions. ÊDNSChanger steals personal information, performs click fraud, and delivers ransomware to victims in order to generate revenue. ÊTDSS and Koobface have been known to drop DNSChanger onto computers to spread infection and download additional malware (e.g. FakeAV) onto compromised machines."NotCompatible,16,2012,12,"NotCompatible is a botnet that targets Android mobile devices. ÊIt is used to distribute spam, perform brute-force attacks against WordPress websites, and scalp event tickets. ÊNotCompatible is installed onto devices either through spam emails or drive-by downloads.  Only devices that have enabled sideloading are susceptible. ÊOnce it infects a device, it consumes large amounts of bandwidth, causes rapid battery drainage, and results in extremely high data charges on consumersÕ monthly bills.

ÊIt copies itself into the System folder, installs itself onto a computer, and deletes the .exe file from which it was executed,  It also creates mutexes to guarantee that it appears only once on the infected machine. ÊIn addition, it injects itself into Explorer.exe, which manages the Start menu, task bar, desktop, files, etc., in an attempt to control these processes under the guise of Windows Explorer. ÊIt is also able to update itself, through its connection via HTTP to one of the tens of C&C (command and control) servers."MyDoom,19,2004,14,"Shortly after its discovery, MyDoom became the fastest spam-spreading worm to date, though it was aslo able to spread via P2P (peer-to-peer) networks.  At its peak, approximately one out of every twelve emails was infected. Once installed onto a computer, it opened a backdoor for remote control, installed additional malware, and performed DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. It mainly targeted government websites in the U.S. and Korea.  MyDoomÕs attacks were trigger-based, in which each version of the malware had a ticking Òtime-bombÓ that was set to launch on a different date.  Most versions also contained a trigger to self-terminate at a particular time. The chief C&C (command and control) server was identified and traced to the U.K., with nearly 167,000 bots answering to its call."Sasser,9,2004,12,"Sasser is a worm that has infected approximately 1.5 million computers with an LSASS (local security authority subsystem service) vulnerability on TCP (transmission control protocol) port 445.  It self-propagates by using infected computers to scan for other vulnerable machines.  The code contains a bug that causes infected machines to shut down every few minutes, and its effects have led to damage worth over $18 billion.  Sasser has infected: Satellite communication, Delta Airline flights, British Coast Guard operation, and hospital emergency rooms. It was written by a 17-year-old German student of computer science, who was arrested and tried as a minor at the age of 18."Blaster,6,2003,18,"Blaster is a worm that performs DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks and creates a backdoor through which an attacker has remote access to an infected machine.  It infected over 100,000 Windows machines in its first week of operation alone.  The malware is launched upon installation and each time an infected computer is powered on after that. Blaster was written by an 18-year-old who was jailed for 18 months, however, no official sentence has ever been recorded."Zunker,13,2007,1,"Zunker is unique among botnets for its management tools; namely, attackers are able to create graphs that monitor the number of active bots at a given time (organized by country) as well as the performance of each bot on a weekly or monthly basis.  These include the amount of spam that the bot distributes and the software it uses to do so. ÊIt controls tens of thousands of bots over 54 countries. ÊOne use for tracking the number of operational bots is that it sends them files that provide the bots with abilities to steal information and perform DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks in addition to spam distribution."GhostNet,8,2009,14,"GhostNet is an espionage botnet whose main purpose is the distribution and operation of spyware.  Within its first two years, it had infected 1,295 computers in over 103 countries.  The main targets, however, are India, the Tibetan government-in-exile, and the countries that belong to the United Nations.  GhostNet communicates with its C&C (command and control) center in China through cloud technologies as well as through social networks and blog sites."Kronos,9,2014,6,"Kronos is a banking Trojan horse that intercepts web traffic to steal credentials.  The HTML injection files are perfectly compatible with Zeus malware, so it is thought that the developers of Kronos designed it in such a way as to be easily implemented by users of Zeus.  Perhaps non-coincidentally, Kronos is the father of Zeus in Greek Mythology; Kronos likely inherited its name from its relationship to the Zeus botnet.  Kronos is able to defend itself from other Trojan horses as well as bypass sandboxes and antivirus software, making it a durable foe.  The infected machines also communicate to the C&C (command and control) center with encrypted data, demonstrating even further detection-evasion capabilities."Pony,2,2013,5,"Pony is a Trojan horse botnet with the primary goal of stealing data from compromised computers. ÊOver $220,000 of cryptocurrency has been reported stolen by Pony as well as nearly three million credentials that include social media and other website logins, email, FTP, and Shell accounts, remote desktops, and ADP payroll. ÊIt uses keystroke logging, or the tracking of the keys that are hit on a given keyboard, as its method of thievery. ÊThe infected computers answer to a C&C (command and control) server that compels them to mine for cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, for financial theft."Pretty Park,19,1999,19,"Pretty Park is one of the first two botnets ever created, the other being Sub7. ÊIt spreads through email attachments that download malware onto the victimÕs computer. ÊIt then tries to connect to an IRC (internet relay chat) channel list every 30 seconds to detect other compromised machines. ÊEvery 30 minutes, it attempts to access the victimÕs email address book and send the same email to all of the email addresses listed. ÊThe downloaded malware also creates a backdoor through which the attacker can control and access data on the computer."Alureon,10,2008,18,"Alureon is a P2P (peer-to-peer) botnet that uses its independent network of peers to send spam emails and install itself onto computers via drive-by downloads. ÊBy 2011, Alureon consisted of over 4.5 million peers. ÊOnce installed, it removes other rootkits on the infected machine to override competing malware and reduce the likelihood of detection by abnormal computer behavior. ÊIt has been known to create a DHCP server that forces the compromised machine to use a malicious DNS server, which redirects Internet traffic to fake or infected websites. ÊIt uses a high number of C&C (command and control) servers that instruct the sending of spam and the redirecting of traffic, but Alureon is far from dependent of them in order to function due to its P2P (peer-to-peer) characteristic."Flashback,19,2011,17,"Flashback is a botnet targeting Mac computers with the purpose of stealing PII (personal identifiable information).  If a user visits an infected website, Flashback either appears as an Adobe Flash Player installer or installs itself more secretly through a vulnerability in Java.  When infected, web browsers, Skype, and other applications contain code that will steal the credentials of the user.  Flashback will also create a backdoor by which the attacker has control of basically any aspect of the infected computer, creating nearly an infinite array of possible crimes."Koobface,20,2008,4,"Koobface gets its name as a partial anagram of ÒFacebook,Ó as it is social network worm.  It is able to create its own accounts on social networking sites and post malicious links in order to spread.  The posts typically consist of video links that take the user to a fake website and prompt him or her to install a Òvideo player update,Ó which is actually malware.  Infected accounts send spam messages to the inboxes of their friendsÕ accounts.  Another characteristic of Koobface is its ability to cheat its way into CAPTCHA breaking.  It finds a CAPTCHA that is blocking its way and prompts the user to solve it without knowing that doing so advances the botnet."Stuxnet,10,2010,8,"Stuxnet is a worm that was created to attack IranÕs Bushehr nuclear power plant.  It spreads through USB devices, and once installed, it searches for a specific PLC (programmable logic controller) controlled by Siemens SIMATIC WinCC/Step 7.  It infects the controller software and makes very specific changes that hint at there being an exact target.  While it uses one C&C (command and control) server in Malaysia and one in Denmark, it operates as a P2P (peer-to-peer) botnet through which the bots communicate to ensure they have latest version.  Perhaps most peculiar is that its takedown was self-imposed, as it had a kill date on which it would intentionally stop and self-delete."Monkif,7,2009,11,"Monkif is a Trojan horse that consists of over 520,000 bots in the U.S. alone. ÊOnce installed, it acts as a BHO (browser helper object) and detects secure HTTP sessions. ÊBy keystroke logging, Monkif can obtain personal information, such as that of a financial transaction, and thus steal money from a victim. ÊIt also makes calls to various websites via DLL (dynamic link library) as well as uses ad-hijacking and drive-by downloads to infect web pages."SpyEye,13,2009,19,"SpyEye is a banking Trojan horse that is considered the successor of Zeus.  Once installed onto a computer, it creates a backdoor through which an attacker can control the machine with remote access.  It contains many characteristics that are similar to Zeus: keystroke logging, credit card grabbing, and web injections that help it steal banking information from the victim.  It even has a Òkill ZeusÓ feature that removes Zeus from any computer that may be infected with it, so SpyEye will not have to compete.  From 2010 to 2012 alone, SpyEye infected over 50 million computers and stole over one billion dollars globally."Andromeda,6,2011,18,"Andromeda is a spam botnet that spreads through removable drives and malicious or hacked websites that contain exploit kits.

ÊIt is also able to Êavoid sandboxes, terminate competing malware, and execute false bank transactions through a remote-access backdoor."Citadel,19,2011,6,"Citadel is a banking Trojan that sends spam, exfiltrates data from browsers, intercepts HTTP traffic and application programming interfaces (APIs), and injects malicious code into websites through man-in-the-browser attacks.  It is thought to be a descendent of Zeus because of its code and configuration characteristics that are similar yet more sophisticated than those of the latter.  Once installed onto a computer, it has the ability to block antivirus/antimalware sites, making it difficult to remove."Ice 9/Ice IX,10,2011,12,"Ice 9 is a Trojan horse that is based on the source code of Zeus. ÊIt is able to evade Tracker sites as well as inject code into banking sites while maintaining the outward appearance of them. ÊConsequently, users less easily detect website malfunction, leading to a more successful theft rate. In addition, it contains keylogging and real-time screenshot functions and is able to grab data from files, Outlook, and other sources. ÊAnother feature is Ice 9Õs ability to create custom Trojan horses that spread to other machines and help spread the infection."Mumblehard,8,2009,12,"Mumblehard is a spam botnet with an automatic delisting feature from SpamhausÕ Composite Blocking List (CBL). ÊBefore its takedown, nearly 4,000 Linux systems had been reported compromised by Mumblehard. ÊThough it is a relatively small botnet, it is widespread.  Mumblehard contains zombie computers from nearly 63 different countries. ÊAnother main feature is a backdoor that allows remote control, but uses just one IP address. ÊInfection can begin from a plugin or an unpatched content management system, such as WordPressor Joomla."Kneber,20,2010,9,"The main purpose of Kneber is to steal credentials from email accounts, social networks, and online banking websites, along with creating remote access and downloading other malware. ÊA majority of machines that are infected with Kneber are also infected with Waledec, which is a spam-producing botnet.

It spreads through drive-by downloads, email attachments, and pop-ups.  Carberp has been reported to have stolen over $250 million from various banks by injecting code into webpages and stalking banking transactions.  The botnet was created by approximately two dozen hackers, all under 30 years of age."Hodprot,10,2009,13,"Hodprot, an ancestor of Carberp, uses RDPdoor malware to steal money from usersÕ computers through a backdoor.  Rather than storing malicious payloads as files, Hodprot uses an encrypted algorithm that customizes to each transaction, making detection very difficult.  It also downloads other malware onto its compromised machines, including Sheldor and Platcyber, all of which serve the purpose of bank fraud."Georbot,13,2011,10,"Georbot is a Trojan horse that targets Georgian nationals and whose purpose is to steal sensitive information. ÊIn order to retrieve the information, Georbot is able to take screenshots, record audio and video, search the hard drive, and scan the network for other bots after it has been installed onto a computer. ÊEarlier versions of Georbot also feature a location check, infecting only the machines that are located in GeorgiaÕs time zone. ÊIt communicates with its C&C (command and control) server using HTTP requests.

The remote C&C (command and control) center is able to choose any target machine and perform the attack, but the majority of victims are companies from which Zemra extorts money.  Typically, a target company receives an email or phone call with a DDoS threat unless it pays a ransom to the account by the given deadline.  The two types of DDoS attacks that it uses are HTTP floods, which mask themselves as legitimate requests, and SYN floods, which overwhelm the system and make it unresponsive to legitimate synchronization requests."Virut,15,2006,9,"Virut is a versatile botnet with many functions: sending email spam, performing click fraud and DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, hosting an Internet proxy service on an infected computer, and more.

It places fake advertisements onto legitimate websites and redirects traffic to fake websites. ÊSince 2006, Esthost has earned its attackers approximately $14 million in stolen funds. ÊAnother function of Esthost is to help spread FakeAV malware. ÊRove Digital, an IT company in Tartu, Estonia, is the alleged party that is responsible for Esthost.  Arrests were made following its takedown on November 8, 2011."Khan,9,2012,11,"Khan is a DDoS (distributed denial of service) botnet that is thought to be related to Dirt Jumper and specializes in HTTP floods that appear as legitimate web traffic.  It is written in Delphi and uses a cryptographic algorithm to obfuscate its C&C (command and control) serversÕ URLs, to remain hidden.  The first two encrypted strings are those upon which Khan is installed onto a victim machine, and each of the remaining five strings refers to a C&C center that generates the DDoS instructions to send to the bots.  Two peculiar aspects of Khan include (1) its lack of a key string and (2) its ADD (addition) decryption algorithm versus the more common XOR (exclusive) operation."Kaiten,16,2001,5,"Kaiten is an IRC (internet relay chat) botnet that is written in C and performs powerful DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks.  It is a botnet that does not spread easily, since an infection requires hacking into a Linux server directly (it is downloaded through a Shellshock vulnerability) and does not compile on much more than thex86-Linux platform. The entirety of KaitenÕs software on one executable file combined with weak user authentication and a simple remote shell also make it a rather penetrable botnet."Shellbot,7,2005,0,"Shellbot is a backdoor Trojan that allows an attacker to gain control of a number of aspects of the victimÕs machine, including access to sensitive data, run or kill computer functions, computer settings, downloading files, performing DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, port scanning, distributing spam, and powering on/off the machine.

It communicates with its C&C (command and control) server primarily through HTTP requests, but it can use IRC (internet relay chat) channels as a secondary mode of communication."Pirpi,11,2009,10,"Pirpi is a backdoor Trojan horse that mainly targets victims in Hong Kong, but has also been seen in Great Britain and the U.S.  It spreads through spam email attachments and, once installed onto a computer, has a keylogging capability for the purpose of data exfiltration.  Not much information is available on Pirpi, but it is controlled by a cyberespionage group named Buckeye or APT-3, which has been active since 2009."Pitou,19,2014,7,"The Pitou botnet is designed to distribute pharmaceutical spam, and receive spam email templates from its C&C (command and control) center.  It contains a sandbox-detection mechanism to avoid analysis by sandboxing.  The botnet runs automatically each time an infected computer starts and spreads via drive-by downloads, spam email attachments, and downloads by another malware, such as Gamarue, Wauchos, and Onkods.  PitouÕs number of infections does not near that of Srizbi, but is geographically widespread, with most infections occurring in Brazil, followed by Peru, Egypt, Vietnam, Venezuela, and very few in the U.S. and Europe. "Onkods,4,2013,19,"Onkods is a botnet whose infection is spread through spam email attachments.  Once a computer is infected, it turns into a ÒzombieÓ computer that is used to send spam and further spread the infection. Onkods has proven difficult to analyze, as it uses a massive loop of API (application program interface) calls to obstruct antivirus software and also contains a FakeAV (fake antivirus software)."
