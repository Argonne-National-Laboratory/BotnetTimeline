Botnet Timeline

This project visualizes the history of Botnets in a vertical time-line format.

D3.js was used to created a scale for the Botnet year, as well as,
optional scales to manipulate the individual box color, size, and
distance from the center axis when more data is collected.

(At this time, all optional scales have random inputs within interval [0-10].)
